# 📝TODO List App (React)

A fully functional and responsive **TODO List Application** built using React.  
It allows users to **add, edit, delete, search, filter, and sort** tasks — with data stored in **localStorage** and synced with a **mock API**.  
The app demonstrates clean component architecture, Context + Reducer-based state management, and optimized rendering performance.
